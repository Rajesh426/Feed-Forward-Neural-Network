# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
Software required Matlab <br/>
 main is the maincode that will run all the sub code in it.<br/>
BPANN is the neural network function that will perform forward and Backward propagation <br/>
ForwardNetwork is the function for computing forward propagation <br/>
In ForwardNetwork function uncommant the softmax on line 9 if want to use softmax function in output layer <br/>
activation function implemented is sigmoid activation function if want to use any activation function need to derviative in the backpropagate <br/>
BackPropagate is the calculate the backword propagartion <br/>
Sigmoid function is the activation function
