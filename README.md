# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
Software required Matlab
 main is the maincode that will run all the sub code in it.
BPANN is the neural network function that will perform forward and Backward propagation
ForwardNetwork is the function for computing forward propagation
In ForwardNetwork function uncommant the softmax on line 9 if want to use softmax function in ouptu layer
activation function implemented is sigmoid activation function if want to use any activation function need to derviative in the backpropagate
BackPropagate is the calculate the backword propagartion
Sigmoid function is the activation function
